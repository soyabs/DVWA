# 2️ SQL Injection (Blind)

Blind SQLi = **No direct output**, attacker infers data using **true/false or time delays**.

---

## LOW Level – Blind SQLi

### Why it is Vulnerable

* No output shown
* SQL query still injectable
* Boolean & time-based attacks possible

---

### Boolean-Based Payloads

#### TRUE condition

```sql
1' AND 1=1 --
```

#### FALSE condition

```sql
1' AND 1=2 --
```

Page loads → TRUE
Page blank → FALSE

---

### Time-Based Payload

```sql
1' AND SLEEP(5) --
```

⏳ 5-second delay confirms vulnerability

---

### Impact

* Database enumeration possible
* Password extraction possible via automation

---

### Severity: **High**

---

## MEDIUM Level – Blind SQLi

### Why it Still Works

* Some filtering applied
* Still vulnerable to **time-based SQLi**
* Error messages suppressed

---

### Payloads

#### Boolean-based

```sql
1 AND 1=1
```

#### Time-based

```sql
1 AND IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0)
```

---

### Result

* Injection successful
* Slower exploitation
* Requires automation


---

### Impact

* Sensitive data extraction
* Stealthy attack

---

### Severity: **Medium**

---

## HIGH Level – Blind SQLi

### Why it is Secure

* Prepared statements
* Strong validation
* No injectable parameters

---

### Payload

```sql
1 AND SLEEP(5)
```

---

### Result

 No delay
 No response difference
 Injection prevented

---

### Severity: **Low (Secure)**

---
