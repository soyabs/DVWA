# Cryptography

**Security Levels:** Low | Medium | High

---

## LOW Level

### Why it is Vulnerable

* Uses weak hashing algorithm
* Passwords stored using MD5
* No salting applied
* Fast hash allows brute force
* Easily crackable hashes

---

### Vulnerable Code

```php
$password = md5($_POST['password']);
```

---

### Payloads (PoC)

#### MD5 Hash Cracking

```
5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
```

---

### Exploitation Steps

* Extract password hash
* Use online/offline hash cracker
* Recover plaintext password

---

### Result

* Password cracked successfully
* Plaintext credentials obtained

---

### Impact

* Account compromise
* Credential reuse attacks

---

### Severity: **High**

---

## MEDIUM Level

### Why it is Vulnerable

* Uses SHA1 hashing
* Salt is static and predictable
* Still vulnerable to rainbow tables
* No key stretching

---

### Code Behavior

```php
$password = sha1("static_salt" . $_POST['password']);
```

---

### Payloads (PoC)

#### Salted Hash Attack

```
sha1(static_salt + password)
```

---

### Exploitation Steps

* Identify static salt
* Append salt to wordlist
* Crack hash offline

---

### Result

* Hash cracked
* Password recovered

---

### Impact

* Weak cryptographic protection
* User credentials exposed

---

### Severity: **Medium**

---

## HIGH Level

### Why it is Vulnerable

* Uses strong hashing algorithm
* Uses bcrypt
* Cost factor is low
* No password pepper used

---

### Vulnerable Configuration

```php
password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT, ['cost' => 4]);
```

---

### Attack Concept

> Exploit **low cost factor** to speed up brute-force attacks.

---

### Payloads (PoC)

#### Offline Brute Force

```
$2y$04$XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

---

### Exploitation Steps

* Obtain password hash
* Use GPU-based cracking
* Leverage low bcrypt cost

---

### Result

* Password cracked faster than expected
* Security weakened by configuration

---

### Impact

* Increased risk of compromise
* Defense weakened by misconfiguration

---

### Severity: **High**

---

## Overall Impact Summary

* Weak hashing breaks authentication
* Static salts provide false security
* Low bcrypt cost reduces effectiveness
* Cryptography misuse is critical
