# Authorization Bypass

**Security Levels:** Low | Medium | High

---

## LOW Level

### Why it is Vulnerable

* No role-based access control
* Sensitive pages directly accessible
* Authorization checks missing
* Relies only on UI restrictions
* Direct Object Reference possible

---

### Vulnerable Behavior

```http
GET /dvwa/admin.php HTTP/1.1
Cookie: PHPSESSID=xxxx
```

---

### Payloads (PoC)

#### Direct URL Access

```
/dvwa/admin.php
/dvwa/config.php
```

---

### Exploitation Steps

* Login as low-privileged user
* Directly access admin endpoint
* Server does not verify role

---

### Result

* Admin page accessible
* Privilege escalation achieved

---

### Impact

* Unauthorized access
* Admin functionality abuse

---

### Severity: **High**

---

## MEDIUM Level

### Why it is Vulnerable

* Authorization implemented client-side
* Role verified using hidden fields
* Parameters can be modified
* No server-side enforcement

---

### Vulnerable Logic

```html
<input type="hidden" name="role" value="user">
```

---

### Payloads (PoC)

#### Parameter Tampering

```
role=admin
```

---

### Exploitation Steps

* Intercept request in Burp Suite
* Modify role parameter
* Forward request to server

---

### Result

* Authorization bypassed
* Admin access granted

---

### Impact

* Privilege escalation
* Broken access control

---

### Severity: **Medium**

---

## HIGH Level

### Why it is Vulnerable

* Server-side authorization implemented
* Object-level access not validated
* User ID trusted from request
* IDOR vulnerability present

---

### Vulnerable Logic

```php
if ($_SESSION['role'] == 'user') {
    view_profile($_GET['id']);
}
```

---

### Attack Concept

> Access **unauthorized objects** by manipulating object identifiers.

---

### Payloads (PoC)

#### IDOR Attack

```
/dvwa/profile.php?id=1
/dvwa/profile.php?id=2
```

---

### Exploitation Steps

* Login as normal user
* Change object ID in request
* Access another user's data

---

### Result

* Unauthorized data accessed
* Authorization logic bypassed

---

### Impact

* Data leakage
* Account compromise
* Privacy violation

---

### Severity: **High**

---

## Overall Impact Summary

* Authorization failures are critical
* Client-side checks are insecure
* IDOR leads to data exposure
* Full application compromise possible
